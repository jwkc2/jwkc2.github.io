<p>This site contains a collection of thoughts and ideas that I've developed over my short career in software engineering. My hope is that at least one person benefits from this resource - particularly someone starting out in the field who would benefit from learning the lessons of experience without having to go through much of the pain. In fact, I would suggest that adopting the principles and habits in these pages is much more important than, say, learning the syntax of any one particular language/platform.</p>
