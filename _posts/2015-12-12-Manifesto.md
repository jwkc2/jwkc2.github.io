Software Engineering is more a craft than a science. Sofware Engineers are craftsmen. We use a variety of tools. We have good and bad habits. We have technique. We become better as we experience more. We discern the gulf between theory and practice. We work well alone and with others. We blend form and function, the aesthetic and composition. We seek order but generate chaos through creativity. We traverse simplicity, complexity, consistency and diversity.
