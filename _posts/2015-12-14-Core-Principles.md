This is short-list of core ideas that's ideal for printing on a small card.

* Don’t reinvent the wheel.
* Ugly, undocumented code is expensive.
* Demo, demo, demo.

* The best argument wins. It’s about finding right answer, not who’s right.
* It isn’t a democracy but everyone gets a say.
* “I don’t know” is a valid answer.
* “I disagree” is a valid response.

* No egos. Insecure narcissists are a misery to work with.
* No false economies. Penny-wise, pound foolish.
* No ignored ‘smells’. Notice it, record it, highlight it.

* No-one owns anything. The illusion of ownership ▶︎ silos ▶︎ disaster
* Never ask anyone to do something you’re not prepared to do yourself.
* Taste your cooking... before serving it to someone else.
* Good Estimation = Experience + Pessimism. Lots of pessimism.
