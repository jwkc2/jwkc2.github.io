I've had the good fortune of working with some amazing, talented people with personalities that make them a joy to be with - which is important when you spend as much time with them as you do your family (if not more!).

Unfortunately, I've also had the nightmare of working with some real nutcases, which is probably more common than not in the tech industry.

Here are some memorable descriptors that apply to them:

* Psychopath
* Sociopath
* Narcissist
* (Aggressively) Insecure
* Bullshitter
* Whiny
* Needy
* Incompetent
