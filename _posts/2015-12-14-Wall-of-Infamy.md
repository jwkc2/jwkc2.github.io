I've had the good misfortune of working with some amazing people - talented and with personalities that make them a joy to be with - which is important when you spend as much time with them as you do your family (if not more!).

Unfortunately, I've also have the nightmares of working with some real nutcases, which is probably even more common than not in the tech industry.

Here are some memorable descriptors that apply to them:

* Psychopath
* Sociopath
* Narcissist
* Insecure (and aggressively so)
* Bullshitter
* Whiny
* Needy
* Incompetent
