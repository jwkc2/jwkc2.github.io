In the course of my career, I've have seen projects and companies brought do their knees by one thing - lack of documentation. In fact, I'm convinced the lack of good documentation is at least the leading cause of spiralling development costs, if not project failure.

The following is what I consider to be an effective definition of what is best practice in documentation.

Why Document?

* Institutional Memory
* Avoid silo-ing of information
* Avoid dependency on individuals - "What if X was hit by a bus tomorrow?!"
* Prevents multiplying cost of development

Documentation is NOT the aim

* Too much and it chokes productivity
* Too little and the project falls into the abyss of abandon-ware
* Documentation should be minimal but must be sufficient

Documentation is…

* A trail of breadcrumbs for the next person (backwards)
* A template to success for you (forwards)

Key Components

* Do have just a few key documents that are continually referenced and updated (‘living’)
* Do create and use document templates
* Main page
* Architectural diagram

Style

* Do have a checklist mentality
* Do have an emphasis on diagrams – architectural, sequences
* Use plain English
* Use the optimal, minimal number of words to communicate

Good Habits

* Do record any manual process
* Do make notes as you go along; if you leave it to the end, you’ll fail
* Post-It Notes are your colour-coded, modular friends.

Source Code

* Do use a documentation tool
* Do an overview for each class, not individual class (member) functions
* Do use one line comments within functions
