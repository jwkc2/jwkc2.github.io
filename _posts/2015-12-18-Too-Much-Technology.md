Technology is an endlessly changing ecosystem, with tools, languages, platforms and frameworks being born, and dying a slow death, all the time. This sucks for the software engineer, who is constantly pushed to adopt the unsettled-new or creakingly-old.

Best Strategy

* Knowing a lot about a little, and a little about a lot, will get you a long way.

Picking Winners

* Adopting a new technology requires an investment of time and mental effort (days/months/years).
* Try to pick winners for the future. In the early days of the VCS wars, I picked Git because although it was new and had its problems, I felt the backing of the Linux community and the distributed model meant that it would offer a better return on investment in the long run over Subversion, which was mature but felt like it had peaked. 8 years later and I’m still reaping the rewards of that decision over those who, say, were forced to use Mercurial or Subversion.
* Sometimes, it’s out of your hands
