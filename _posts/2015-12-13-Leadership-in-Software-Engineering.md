In many software engineering contexts and situations, one needs to exhibit good leadership qualities, whether is nominally the appointed leader or not.

Here are some thoughts on leadership I developed with experience.

* Has a vision (where to go)
* Has a strategy (how to get there), without being dogmatic
* Clear, simple, effective communication

* Defines the standard, by example
* Cool under pressure
* Secure in own skin
* Never asks anyone to do anything theyâ€™re not prepared to do

* Focussed and determined, without being myopic
* Pro-active
* Engaged and responsive
