In many software engineering contexts and situations, one needs to exhibit good leadership qualities, whether as the appointed leader, just filling in, or even just picking up the slack on some piece of work.

Here are some thoughts on leadership that I developed with experience.

* Has a vision (where to go)
* Has a strategy (how to get there), without being dogmatic
* Clear, simple, effective communication

* Sets the standard, by example
* Cool under pressure
* Secure in own skin
* Never asks anyone to do anything theyâ€™re not prepared to do

* Focussed and determined, without being myopic
* Pro-active
* Engaged and responsive
